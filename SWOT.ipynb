        "Image by OleksandrKalinichenko via iStock\n",
        "\n",
        "PetroChina Co. Ltd. and Shell PLC have agreed on an additional investment in the Surat Gas Project (SGP), their joint venture in Australia that is targeted to produce about five trillion cubic feet of natural gas over 27 years.\n",
        "\n",
        "Like phase one, which was approved by the partners 2020, phase two will supply a Shell-operated liquefaction plant on Curtis Island in the state of Queensland, Shell said in a statement. The liquefied natural gas (LNG) is meant for export, but the Surat Gas Project will also deliver gas for the domestic market.\n",
        "\n",
        "Phase two, or SGP North, has an expected peak output of about 130 million cubic feet a day, with up to 450 production wells targeted to be drilled. Shell expects to start production 2026.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Surat Gas Project is operated by the British energy giant and state-backed PetroChina’s 50-50 joint venture Arrow Energy Pty. Ltd.\n",
        "\n",
        "Arrow said in a separate press release construction is scheduled to start later in 2024. The infrastructure will include a new field compression station and a 27-kilometer (16.8 miles) pipeline. Works also include upgrades for roads and other existing infrastructure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Meanwhile phase one, which consists of over 600 wells, has an expected peak production of 90 billion feet a year according to Shell’s announcement of the final investment decision April 17, 2020.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Surat Gas Project, which targets coal seams in the namesake basin, is part of Arrow’s 27-year agreement to supply QCLNG (QCG), the operator of the Queensland LNG facility. QCG is a joint venture operated by Shell with a 73.75 percent stake, with state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp. and EIG Management LLC owning 25 percent and 1.25 percent respectively. Last year QCG supplied 15 percent of gas demand on Australia’s east coast according to Shell.\n",
        "\n",
        "“QCLNG marked its 1000th cargo at the end of last year, reflecting its significance as a gas supplier for Australia and the region”, said Zoë Yujnovich, director for integrated gas and upstream at Shell. “This investment will enable us to sustain and grow this important, secure energy source that offers a lower emissions alternative to options like coal”.\n",
        "\n",
        "Shell aims to grow its LNG production by 20–30 percent by 2030 relative to 2022, as declared in the company’s Energy Transition Strategy 2024 report.\n",
        "\n",
        "It said in an outlook report February 14, 2024, that it expected global LNG demand to rise by over 50 percent by 2040, driven by an accelerating industrial switch from coal to gas in China and economic growth-driven demand in South and Southeast Asia.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Shell believes LNG will play a critical role in the energy transition, replacing coal in heavy industry”, the company said in the Surat phase two news release. “It also has a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, helping to reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. LNG helps to provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewable generation is growing rapidly”.\n",
        "\n",
        "Shell added, “The investment in Phase 2 is expected to generate an internal rate of return in excess of the hurdle rate for Shell’s Integrated Gas business”.\n",
        "\n",
        "Arrow chief executive Zhengxin Peng said about the additional Surat investment, “At a time when more gas is needed for homes, businesses and industries, the SGP North development will solidify Arrow’s position as a major producer of natural gas on the east coast”.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the employment side, Arrow expects to offer up to 400 jobs for phase two.\n",

        "Florham Park, N.J. - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has finalized a settlement with international chemical company BASF Corporation resolving its violations of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). BASF has certified that it is now in full compliance with federal reporting requirements and has agreed to pay a $700,000 penalty for the past violations. This settlement is part of EPA’s core work to protect communities through chemical safety oversight.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Chemical data reporting is a critical tool that helps EPA ensure the safety of chemicals used in communities across the country, including right here in New Jersey,” said EPA Regional Administrator Michael Martucci. “Companies are responsible for submitting accurate and timely reports. This case reflects EPA’s approach of fair but firm enforcement when those obligations are not met.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The violations occurred at BASF’s U.S. headquarters in Florham Park, New Jersey, during the 2020 TSCA chemical reporting period. EPA found that the company did not provide information within the required timeframe about hundreds of substances that it was required to report under TSCA. These submissions help the EPA evaluate potential chemical risks and guide decisions that protect public health and the environment. BASF has corrected its submission and cooperated throughout EPA's investigation.\n",
        "\n",
        "EPA remains committed to helping regulated facilities meet their responsibilities under TSCA and other environmental laws. Through training, technical assistance, and case-by-case problem solving, EPA works to keep communities safe and businesses thriving across New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n",
